# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_API_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your personal access token by logging into the application, navigating to your account settings, and creating a new API token in the <b>API Tokens</b> section.
